# UX setup: Snapmark

Every `ux:` skill reads this file first. Keep it short and true.

## The product

- **What it is:** a macOS menu bar app that captures a screen region, lets you mark it up, and appends it with your notes to a Markdown session an AI agent can read.
- **Platform:** desktop — Electron 44, macOS only. Menu bar app; a Dock icon shows while an editor or session window is open.
- **Audience file:** none; the owner confirmed these scenes on 2026-09-25 ("I think this are the main use cases").
  1. **Reviewing an overnight build:** a complete UX/UI review of what an agent built overnight, with detailed feedback on many different elements, captured on the fly with shortcuts, then handed to Claude Code. The main scene.
  2. **Sharing with a person:** the same session as a PDF or ZIP for a teammate or stakeholder.
  3. **A quick verdict:** mark what should go and what should stay (red remove, green approve) on one screenshot.
- **Jobs to be done:** point at something on screen precisely; say what should change; collect it in one file per piece of work; hand it to an AI in a token-efficient way.
- **Products the audience already uses** (for pattern research, owner's answer 2026-09-25): macOS Screenshot (the built-in `⌘⇧4`/`⌘⇧5` markup), Figma, Ocra (as written), Xnapper.

## The rules it must follow

- **Design system:** none. The editor's colours are CSS tokens in `src/editor.html` (`--accent: #e11d48`); app and menu bar icons in `assets/`.
- **Glossary:** none yet — `docs/ux/glossary-proposal.md`.
- **Voice and writing rules:** none in the repo.
- **Hard rules** that override UX preferences (from the owner's words):
  - Everything must be doable on the fly with shortcuts.
  - The output is a Markdown document including the images, organised as sessions.
  - macOS first; Electron + TypeScript.
  - Remove marks are always red and approve marks always green.

## The owner's words

- **File:** `docs/ux/owner-words.md` — every request, verbatim, dated. Quote from it; never cite a request by number.

## How to run it for an audit

- **Build and run:** `npm ci && npm run smoke`. It renders a mock app page, opens the real editor on it, uses every tool, saves, exports a PDF, and writes `editor.png` (the editor window) and `smoke/img/001.png` (the saved image) to a temp folder it prints as `root:`.
- **Scale check:** `npm run build && npx electron --force-device-scale-factor=1 dist/test/smoke.js` for a non-Retina screen.
- **Test data:** the mock page inside `test/smoke.ts`; `SNAPMARK_ROOT` points sessions at a temp folder. Never the owner's screen.
- **Screenshots go to:** `docs/ux/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>/shots/`
- **Window sizes:** editor at its minimum 1180 × 600, and 1440 and 1920 wide; Retina (2×) and 1×.
- **Builds to audit:** `main` (v0.9.0 and later). No open pull requests.
- **Not scriptable:** the menu bar menu, macOS's capture overlay, notifications, native dialogs and Spaces (full-screen apps). Evaluate those from the code and the owner's reports; say which in each finding. The area picker can be driven like the smoke test does (`pickArea()` plus input events to its window); its screenshot shows only Snapmark's own window.

## Safety

- **Never write to:** `~/Documents/Snapmark/` (the owner's real sessions), `~/Library/Application Support/snapmark/state.json` (the installed app's state), the owner's login items (the Open at login toggle), the owner's clipboard.
- **Read only:** the owner's sessions, if a real example is needed, and only with the owner's permission.
- **Never capture:** the owner's real screen. Use the mock page. Never press `⌃⇧1`, `⌃⇧2` or `⌃⇧3`, and never run `screencapture`.
- **Writes only against:** temp folders via `SNAPMARK_ROOT`, and `~/Library/Application Support/Electron/` (where the smoke test keeps its state, because it runs without the app's package name).

## Flows for this product

Beyond the minimum in `rule-areas.md`:

- Capture, mark, save, capture the next one (scene 1).
- Start a new session and switch back to an older one (scene 1).
- Hand a session to an agent: Copy prompt for AI, paste (scene 1).
- Share with a person: export PDF or ZIP (scene 2).
- Move sessions into iCloud Drive or Google Drive (scene 2).
- Mark what goes and what stays on one screenshot (scene 3).
- Cut an element and move it where it should go (scene 1).
- Place a card that points at an element, then move the card (scene 1).
- Fix a mistake: undo, select, delete (all scenes).
- First launch up to the first saved screenshot (all scenes).
