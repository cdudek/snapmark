# Snapmark sitemap

Snapmark has no pages or routes. It has surfaces, reached from the menu bar icon, three global keys and
each other. This file shows how they are reached today (v0.9.0) and how the proposed interaction
guidelines would arrange them.

## As built (v0.9.0)

Sources: the menu data rendered for four states (agent 1), agent 2's every-way-in-and-out and
where-things-open tables, agent 4's key × screen map, and the other evaluators' findings. Items marked
_(native)_ are macOS's own; _(silent)_ gives the reviewer no sign.

```

### Named or reachable two ways

- The editor: ⌃⇧1, ⌃⇧3, Choose New Area…, Reopen Last Discarded, Reopen Discarded…, Edit Again.
- The session window: Open Session; restoring a removed screenshot.
- "Discard" (editor) and "Remove from Session" (session window) end in one store; "Reopen" brings back both
  with different results (F223).
- "Capture Screenshot" (menu) = "Capture region" (Keyboard Shortcuts, README) (F224).
- One session: "28 Sep 09.14" (menu, most notifications) and "2026-09-28 09.14" (editor, session window,
  session.md, the New Session notification) (F201/F222, F222).
- ⌘W in the editor: "Discard" (button, key list) and "Close Window" (Mac menu bar) (F110).
