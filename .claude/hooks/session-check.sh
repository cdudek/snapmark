# -#-#- STALE COPIES -#-#-
# WHY THIS IS AT SESSION START. The hooks, the workflows and the guardrail test that CI
# actually runs are COPIES inside this repo -- CI runs on a runner with no plugin installed.
# They do not update themselves. So a repo can sit for weeks passing its own stale checks
# while the kit has already changed the rule, and nothing says a word. `status.sh` knows,
# but only when something asks it, and chain step 0 asks only once a change is already
# starting -- by then the stale guardrail is what fails the PR.
#
# Best effort by design: the kit lives at a cache path that changes on every plugin update,
# and old versions are never swept, so a machine holds many copies at once. This asks EVERY
# copy and stays quiet when the repo matches ANY of them -- a repo that matches an installed
# kit is not stale, whichever copy a session happens to load. Picking one copy by mtime is
# what made this cry wolf: it landed on a kit OLDER than the repo and reported the repo
# behind. A SessionStart hook that guesses wrong must cost nothing.
#
# Only a copy that actually has the flag is ever run. An adopt.py predating it treats
# `--templates-hash` as an ordinary run and REWRITES THE REPO -- a full adopt, from a
# session hook, unasked. 20 of the 31 copies on the machine that found this were that old.
